    question: `What is HTML question 1?
    The odds are that you won’t be asked this directly, but it can’t hurt to remind yourself what HTML stands for: Hyper Text Markup Language.
     This means that an HTML document, written in plain text, is used to describe the structure and content of web pages, with links to other pages and resources. In its most basic form, you can define blocks of content, which are displayed depending on the type of block you used.`,

    question: `What is the difference between HTML elements and tags question 2?
    Elements
    Each part of a web page, such as a paragraph, an image, a link or anything else you can interact with, is an element. Each type of element has its own behavior - for answer you can click on links, or type in text boxes.

    question: `What are attributes and how do you use them Qeustion 3?
    Each tag can also have additional attributes, which change the way the tag behaves or is displayed. For answer, an <input> tag has a type attribute, which you can use to specify whether it’s a text field, checkbox, radio button or one of many more options.
    
    Attributes are specified directly after the name of the tag, inside the two angled brackets. They should only ever appear in opening tags or in self-closing tags - they can never be in closing tags. They are followed by an equals sign = and the chosen value in double quotes ". Take care not to include any spaces before and after the equals sign! Multiple attributes can be defined on a single tag, separated by a space.`,
