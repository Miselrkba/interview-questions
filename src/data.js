    question: `7. What is the difference between the usage of an ID and a Class?`,
    answer: ` ID – An ID is unique. A particular ID can be only assigned to a single element. IDs are used when specific styling is being tried to be achieved over a single element. Below is a pictorial example of how to use an ID.


    Class – Just like the word suggests, a class is a collective way of targetting HTML elements for styling. Classes are not unique and multiple elements can have the same class. In fact, multiple classes can also be added to the same element to achieve the desired style and look. Below is an example of the usage of classes.

    question: `8. What is the RGB stream? `,
    answer: ` RGB is a system of representing a certain colour in CSS. There are three streams in this nomenclature of representing a colour, namely the Red, Green and Blue stream. The intensity of the three colours is represented in numbers ranging from 0 to 256. This allows CSS to have a wide range of colours spreading across the entire spectrum of visible colours. `,

    question: `9. What are web safe fonts and fallback fonts?`,
    answer: `Not all operating systems and browsers have the same fonts installed. Web safe fonts are fonts that are commonly pre-installed on many computer systems, such as Arial and Times New Roman. In case the browser or operating system doesn’t recognize the first font you set (e.g. Ubuntu), you should choose a web safe fallback font to display (e.g. Arial), followed by a generic font family (e.g. sans-serif). If your fallback font doesn’t display either, the browser can pick a generic font in the sans-serif family. `,

    question: `10. What are the ways to assign a certain colour to an element in CSS?`,
    answer: `Hexadecimal notation
    *******
    A colour in hexadecimal string notation always begins with the character “#”. After that, the hexadecimal digits of the colour code is written. The string is case-insensitive.
    RGB functional notation
    *******
    RGB (Red/Green/Blue) functional notation, like hexadecimal string notation, represents colours using their red, green, and blue components (as well as, optionally, an alpha channel component for opacity). However, instead of using a string, the colour is defined using the CSS function RGB(). This function accepts as its input parameters the values of the red, green, and blue components and an optional fourth parameter, the value for the alpha channel.
    HSL functional notation
    *******
    Designers and artists often prefer to work using the HSL (Hue/Saturation/Luminosity) colour method. On the web, HSL colours are represented using HSL functional notation. The HSL() CSS function is very similar to the RGB() function in usage otherwise

    question: `11. Explain the CSS Box Model and its different elements.`,
    answer: `The CSS box model describes the rectangular boxes that are generated for elements in the document tree and laid out according to the visual formatting model. Each box has a content area (e.g. text, an image, etc.) and an optional surrounding padding, border, and margin
    The box model has the following rules:
The dimensions of a block element are calculated by width, height, padding, borders, and margin.
If no height is specified, a block element will be as high as the content it contains, plus padding.
If no width is specified, a non-floated block element will expand to fit the width of its parent minus padding.
The height of an element is calculated by the content’s height.
The width of an element is calculated by the content’s width.
By default, padding and border are not part of the width and height of an element. `,

    answer: `The z-index helps specify the stack order of positioned elements that may overlap one another. The z-index default value is zero and can take on either a positive or negative number.
    An element with a higher z-index is always stacked above than a lower index. Auto: Sets the stack order equal to its parents.
    Number: Orders the stack order.
    Initial: Sets this property to its default value (0).

    answer: `CSS sprites combine multiple images into one single larger image. It is a commonly-used technique for icons (Gmail uses it). This is how you could implement it:
    1. Use a sprite generator that packs multiple images into one and generates the appropriate CSS for it.
    2. Each image would have a corresponding CSS class with background-image, background-position and background-size properties defined.
    3. To use that image, add the corresponding class to your element. `,

    question: `19. What will this piece of CSS code do to an element? .container { margin: 0 auto; }`,
    answer: `When you have specified a width on the object that you have applied margin: 0 auto to, the object will sit centrally within its parent container. Specifying auto as the second parameter basically tells the browser to automatically determine the left and right margins itself, which it does by setting them equally. It guarantees that the left and right margins will be set to the same size. The first parameter 0 indicates that the top and bottom margins will both be set to 0.  `,

    question: `31. How does a browser determine what elements match a CSS selector?`,
    answer: `Browsers match selectors from rightmost (key selector) to left. Browsers filter out elements in the DOM according to the key selector and traverse up its parent elements to determine matches. The shorter the length of the selector chain, the faster the browser can determine if that element matches the selector.
    For example with this selector p span, browsers firstly find all the <span> elements and traverse up its parent all the way up to the root to find the <p> element. For a particular <span>, as soon as it finds a <p>, it knows that the <span> matches and can stop its matching.

  {
    id: "c1",
    language: "Css",
    question: `32. Explain the scenario you would use translate() instead of absolute positioning?  `,
    answer: `Translate is a value of CSS transform. Changing transform or opacity does not trigger browser reflow or repaint but does trigger compositions; whereas changing the absolute positioning triggers reflow. Transform causes the browser to create a GPU layer for the element but changing absolute positioning properties uses the CPU. Hence translate() is more efficient and will result in shorter paint times for smoother animations.
    When using translate(), the element still occupies its original space (sort of like position: relative), unlike in changing the absolute positioning.  `,

    question: `33. Explain the difference in approach when designing a responsive website over a mobile-first strategy?`,
    answer: `These two approaches are not exclusive. Making a website responsive means some elements will respond by adapting its size or other functionality according to the device’s screen size, typically the viewport width, through CSS media queries.
    A mobile-first strategy is also responsive, however, it agrees we should default and define all the styles for mobile devices, and only add specific responsive rules to other devices later. 
    A mobile-first strategy has 2 main advantages:
    It’s more performant on mobile devices since all the rules applied for them don’t have to be validated against any media queries
    It forces to write cleaner code in respect to responsive CSS rules.  `,

  {
    id: "c1",
    language: "Css",
    question: `34. What are the different ways to position a certain element in CSS?`,
    answer: `The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.
    There are five different position values:
    position: fixed;
    position: static;
    position: absolute;
    position: sticky;
    position: relative;
    Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first. They also work differently depending on the position value.

  {
    id: "c1",
    language: "Css",
    question: `35. What effect would this piece of CSS code have? {box-sizing: border-box;} `,
    answer: `By default, elements have box-sizing: content-box applied, and only the content size is being accounted for.
    box-sizing: border-box changes how the width and height of elements are being calculated, border and padding are also being included in the calculation.
    The height of an element is now calculated by the content’s height + vertical padding + vertical border width.
    The width of an element is now calculated by the content’s width + horizontal padding + horizontal border width.
    Taking into account paddings and borders as part of our box model resonates better with how designers actually imagine content in grids.  `,

    language: "Css",
    question: `36. What is a CSS pre-processor? When do you recommend a pre-processor be used in a project?`,
    answer: ` A CSS preprocessor is a program that lets you generate CSS from the preprocessor’s own unique syntax. There are many CSS preprocessors to choose from, however, most CSS preprocessors will add some features that don’t exist in pure CSS, such as mixin, nesting selector, inheritance selector, and so on. These features make the CSS structure more readable and easier to maintain.
    The usage depends on the type of project but the following advantages/disadvantages come with a preprocessor.
    Advantages:
    CSS is made more maintainable.
    Easy to write nested selectors.
    Variables for consistent theming. Can share theme files across different projects.
    Mixins to generate repeated CSS.
    Sass features like loops, lists, and maps can make configuration easier and less verbose.
    Splitting your code into multiple files. CSS files can be split up too but doing so will require an HTTP request to download each CSS file.
    Disadvantages:
    Requires tools for preprocessing. Re-compilation time can be slow.
    Not writing currently and potentially usable CSS. For example, by using something like postcss-loader with webpack, you can write potentially future-compatible CSS, allowing you to use things like CSS variables instead of Sass variables. Thus, you’re learning new skills that could pay off if/when they become standardized. `,

    language: "Css",
    question: `37. What’s the difference between a relative, fixed, absolute and statically positioned element?`,
    answer: `A positioned element is an element whose computed position property is either relative, absolute, fixed or sticky.
    Static
    The default position; the element will flow into the page as it normally would. The top, right, bottom, left and z-index properties do not apply.
    Relative
    The element’s position is adjusted relative to itself, without changing the layout (and thus leaving a gap for the element where it would have been had it not been positioned).
    Absolute
    The element is removed from the flow of the page and positioned at a specified position relative to its closest positioned ancestor if any, or otherwise relative to the initial containing block. Absolutely positioned boxes can have margins, and they do not collapse with any other margins. These elements do not affect the position of other elements.
    Fixed
    The element is removed from the flow of the page and positioned at a specified position relative to the viewport and doesn’t move when scrolled.
    Sticky
    Sticky positioning is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. The element is treated as relative positioned until it crosses a specified threshold, at which point it is treated as fixed positioned.  `,

    question: `38. What is file splitting? When is it used?`,
    answer: ` Part of a good CSS architecture is file organization. A monolithic file is fine for solo developers or very small projects. For large projects—sites with multiple layouts and content types, or multiple brands under the same design umbrella—it’s smarter to use a modular approach and split your CSS across multiple files. `,

    answer: `Functions are blocks of code that return a single value of any Sass data type.  A mixin is very similar to a function. The main difference between the two is that mixins output lines of Sass code that will compile directly into CSS styles, while functions return a value that can then become the value for a CSS property or become something that might be passed to another function or mixin.  `,

    answer: `Advantages of using CSS3 animations over script-based animation techniques are as follows:
    1. Easy to use and anybody can create them without the knowledge of JavaScript.
    2. Executes well even under reasonable system load. As simple animations perform poorly in JavaScript, the rendering engine uses the frame-skipping techniques to allow smooth flow of animation.
    3. Allows the browser to control the animation sequence, optimize performance and efficiency by reducing the update frequency of animations executing in tabs that aren’t currently visible.  `,

    question: `64. What is clearfix `,
    answer: `The clearfix is a CSS hack that solves a persistent bug that occurs when two floated elements are stacked next to each other. When elements are aligned this way, the parent container ends up with a height of 0, and it can easily wreak havoc on a layout. All you might be trying to do is position a sidebar to the left of your main content block, but the result would be two elements that overlap and collapse on each other. To complicate things further, the bug is inconsistent across browsers. The clearfix was invented to solve all that.

    question: `2. What is OOP? `,
    answer: `OOP is that we use objects to model elements that we want to represent inside our programs, and/or provide a simple way to access functionality.Objects can contain related data and code, which represent information about the element you are trying to model, and functionality or behavior that you want it to have. Object data (and often, functions too) can be stored neatly (the official word is encapsulated) inside an object package (which can be given a specific name to refer to, which is sometimes called a namespace), making it easy to structure and access; objects are also commonly used as data stores that can be easily sent across the network.  `,

    question: `3. Encapsulation? `,
    answer: `Encapsulation means hiding information or data. It refers to the ability of the object to execute its functionality without revealing any execution details to the caller. In other words, the private variable is only visible to the current function and is not accessible to the global scope or other functions. *************** const Book = function(t, a) {
        let title = t; 
        let author = a; 
        
        return {
           summary : function() {

     }
     const book1 = new Book('Hippie', 'Paulo Coelho');
     book1.summary();
     > Hippie written by Paulo Coelho. ***************  
     In the above code the title and the author are only visible inside the scope of the function Book and the method summary is visible to the caller of Book. So the title and the author are encapsulated inside Book.`,

    question: `54. What is the difference between Local storage & Session storage?`,
    answer: `Local Storage – The data is not sent back to the server for every HTTP request (HTML, images, JavaScript, CSS, etc) – reducing the amount of traffic between client and server. It will stay until it is manually cleared through settings or program.
    Session Storage – It is similar to local storage; the only difference is while data stored in local storage has no expiration time, data stored in session storage gets cleared when the page session ends. Session Storage will leave when the browser is closed. `,

    question: `55.What is an event bubbling in JavaScript? `,
    answer: `Event bubbling is a way of event propagation in the HTML DOM API, when an event occurs in an element inside another element, and both elements have registered a handle for that event. With bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements. The execution starts from that event and goes to its parent element. Then the execution passes to its parent element and so on till the body element. `,

    question: `56.How are JavaScript primitive/object types passed in functions? `,
    answer: `One of the differences between the two is that Primitive Data Types are passed By Value and Objects are passed By Reference.
    By Value means creating a COPY of the original. Picture it like twins: they are born exactly the same, but the first twin doesn’t lose a leg when the second twin loses his in the war.
     By Reference means creating an ALIAS to the original. When your Mom calls you “Pumpkin Pie” although your name is Margaret, this doesn’t suddenly give birth to a clone of yourself: you are still one, but you can be called by these two very different names. `,

    question: `57.What is the ‘Strict’ mode in JavaScript and how can it be enabled? `,
    answer: `Strict mode is a way to introduce better error-checking into your code.
    When you use strict mode, you cannot use implicitly declared variables, or assign a value to a read-only property, or add a property to an object that is not extensible.
    You can enable strict mode by adding “use strict” at the beginning of a file, a program, or a function. `,

    answer: `A prompt box is a box which allows the user to enter input by providing a text box. The prompt() method displays a dialog box that prompts the visitor for input. A prompt box is often used if you want the user to input a value before entering a page. When a prompt box pops up, the user will have to click either “OK” or “Cancel” to proceed after entering an input value. `,

    question: `59. How to empty an Array in JavaScript? `,
    answer: `Method 1 –


    1
    arrayList = []
    Above code will set the variable arrayList to a new empty array. This is recommended if you don’t have references to the original array arrayList anywhere else, because it will actually create a new, empty array. You should be careful with this method of emptying the array, because if you have referenced this array from another variable, then the original reference array will remain unchanged.
    
    Method 2 –
    
    
    1
    arrayList.length = 0;
    The code above will clear the existing array by setting its length to 0. This way of emptying the array also updates all the reference variables that point to the original array. Therefore, this method is useful when you want to update all reference variables pointing to arrayList. `,

    question: `60.Event Delegation `,
    answer: `JavaScript event delegation is a simple technique by which you add a single event handler to a parent element in order to avoid having to add event handlers to multiple child elements. 53. vent delegation makes use of two often overlooked features of JavaScript events: event bubbling and the target element. When an event is triggered on an element, for example a mouse click on a button, the same event is also triggered on all of that element’s ancestors. This process is known as event bubbling; the event bubbles up from the originating element to the top of the DOM tree. The target element of any event is the originating element, the button in our example, and is stored in a property of the event object. Using event delegation it’s possible to add an event handler to an element, wait for an event to bubble up from a child element and easily determine from which element the event originated.  `,

    question: `61.Protype inheritance`,
    answer: `54. When it comes to inheritance, JavaScript only has one construct: objects. Each object has a private property which holds a link to another object called its prototype. That prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with null as its prototype. By definition, null has no prototype, and acts as the final link in this prototype chain.
    Nearly all objects in JavaScript are instances of Object which sits on the top of a prototype chain. `,

    question: `62.AMD vs. CommonJS? Vs ES6  `,
    answer: `CommonJS (CJS)

    This system relies on importing and exporting modules thanks to some well-known keywords: require and exports.7
    The commonJS team created this API as a synchronous one which is not that good for browsers... Moreover, Commonjs isn't natively understood by browsers; it requires either a loader library or some transpiling.
    
    
    Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD)
    AMD is some kind of a split of CommonJS. It has been created by members of the CJS team that disagreed with the direction taken by the rest of the team.
    
    They've decided to create AMD to support asynchronous module loading. This is the module system used by RequireJS and that is working client-side (in browsers).
    
    ES2015 Modules (ESM)
    As those 3 formats are not that easy to read, hard to analyze for static code analyzer and not supported everywhere, The ECMA team (the team behind the standardization of Javascript) decided to create the ECMAScript 2015 (also known as ES6) standard. This format is really simple to read and write and supports both synchronous and asynchronous modes of operation. `,

    question: `63.Hash table `,
    answer: `Hash Table is a data structure which stores data in an associative manner. In a hash table, data is stored in an array format, where each data value has its own unique index value. Access to data becomes very fast if we know the index of the desired data.
    Thus, it becomes a data structure in which insertion and search operations are very fast irrespective of the size of the data. Hash Table uses an array as a storage medium and uses the hash technique to generate an index where an element is to be inserted or is to be located from. `,

    question: `65.Module Patterns `,
    answer: `It is a commonly used Design Pattern which is used to wrap a set of variables and functions together in a single scope.
    It is used to define objects and specify the variables and the functions that can be accessed from outside the scope of the function. We expose certain properties and function as public and can also restrict the scope of properties and functions within the object itself, making them private. This means that those variables cannot be accessed outside the scope of the function. We can achieve data hiding an abstraction using this pattern in the JavaScript. `,

    question: `66.What's the difference between host objects and native objects in javascript `,
    answer: `Host Objects are objects supplied by a certain environment. They are not always the same because each environment differs and contains host objects that accommodates execution of ECMAScript. Example, browser environment supplies objects such as window. While a node.js/server environment supplies objects such as NodeList.
    Native Objects or Built-in Objects are standard built-in objects provided by Javascript. Native objects is sometimes referred to as ‘Global Objects’ since they are objects Javascript has provided natively available for use. `,

    question: `67. whats the difference between these 3: **
    *function Person(){}
    *var person = Person()
    *var person = new Person() `,
    answer: `function Person() {}
    Declares (instantiates) a named function in memory, but does not execute it. This function can be called at a later point with the code Person(); . An important not here is that declared functions are available for use even before they are declared (as long as they are eventually declared).
    
    var person = Person()
    Declares a new function, Person, invokes it and then assigns the return value to the variable person. Important to understand here is that the variable is first hoisted to the top of the current scope and then when the assignment is encountered in the flow of code, the function Person is run and the result assigned. Until that point, the value of person is undefined.
    
    var person = new Person()
    In this case, we have the introduction of the new keyword which means that Person is an object constructor function which returns a new object instance. So while person in the example above is the returned value of Person (a string, number or whatever), the value of person in this example is actually an object. `,

    question: `68. Call and Apply`,
    answer: `call and apply are very similar—they invoke a function with a specified this context, and optional arguments. The difference between call() and apply() is that call() passes all arguments after the first one on to the invoked function, while apply() takes an array as its second argument and passes the members of that array as arguments. The following have the same effect.
    someFunc.call(thisArg, 1, 2, 3) VS someFunc.apply(thisArg, [1, 2, 3]) `,

    The following illustrates the syntax of the bind() method:
    fn.bind(thisArg[, arg1[, arg2[, ...]]])
    In this syntax, the bind() method returns a copy of the function fn with the specific this value (thisArg) and arguments (arg1, arg2, …).
    Unlike the call() and apply() methods, the bind() method doesn’t immediately execute the function. It just returns the function. `,

    question: `70. Document.Write()`,
    answer: `When document.write() is executed after page load, it replaces the entire header and body tag with the given parameter value in string. An invocation could look like this:
    document.write(‘<h1>hello world</h1>’);
    When working with web application, it is uncommon task to overwrite an entire page, hence why using document.write() is bad practice. It cannot inject string text into a given node point unlike jQuery library selectors and native JavaScript methods. Ref: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document
    Another reason not to use document.write() is it doesn’t support XHTML, but its not an issue since most web development uses HTML. Since document.write() fires after a page has finish loading, it causes performance issues and sometimes, may not even fire at all.
    The only seem appropriate usage for document.write() is when working third parties like Google Analytics and such for including their scripts. This is because document.write() is mostly available in any browser. Since third party companies have no control over the user’s browser dependencies (ex. jQuery), document.write() can be used as a fallback or a default method. `,

    question: `71.AJAX `,
    answer: `Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. AJAX just uses a combination of:

    A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
    JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)
    
    AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.
    
    Conventional web applications transmit information to and from the sever using synchronous requests. It means you fill out a form, hit submit, and get directed to a new page with new information from the server.
    With AJAX, when you hit submit, JavaScript will make a request to the server, interpret the results, and update the current screen. In the purest sense, the user would never know that anything was even transmitted to the server. `,

  {
    id: "j1",
    language: "JavaScript",
    question: `72.What is JSONP? `,
    answer: `The XMLHttpRequest(XHR) can be used to get the data from the server. Once the data is received in the browser it can use the JSON.parse() method to convert the received JSON string into JavaScript object. But, XHR comes with the same-origin security issue. This means, request a page from some domain, let’s say ADomain.com and then that page makes a XMLHttpRequest to get some data from BDomain.com, the browser denies this request. This is because the request was made to a different domain than the domain the page was served from. Only if the XMLHttpRequest is made to ADomain.com, it will receive back the data as XHR works only if the request is made to the same domain.

    JSONP (JSON with Padding): It is a way to retrieve data by avoiding the cross-domain issue. The script tag is used to do so. `,

    question: `73.Hoisting `,
    answer: `Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function).  
    Variables defined with let and const are hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.
    Meaning: The block of code is aware of the variable, but it cannot be used until it has been declared.
    In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared. 
    x = 5; // Assign 5 to x
    
    elem = document.getElementById("demo"); // Find an element
    elem.innerHTML = x;                     // Display x in the element

    question: `75.What is same origin policy ? `,
    answer: `The same-origin policy is a browser security feature that restricts how documents and scripts on one origin can interact with resources on another origin.

    A browser can load and display resources from multiple sites at once. You might have multiple tabs open at the same time, or a site could embed multiple iframes from different sites. If there is no restriction on interactions between these resources, and a script is compromised by an attacker, the script could expose everything in a user's browser.
    
    The same-origin policy prevents this from happening by blocking read access to resources loaded from a different origin. "But wait," you say, "I load images and scripts from other origins all the time." Browsers allow a few tags to embed resources from a different origin. This policy is mostly a historical artifact and can expose your site to vulnerabilities such as clickjacking using iframes. You can restrict cross-origin reading of these tags using a Content Security Policy.
    
    What's considered same-origin? #
    An origin is defined by the scheme (also known as the protocol, for example HTTP or HTTPS), port (if it is specified), and host. When all three are the same for two URLs, they are considered same-origin. For example, http://www.example.com/foo is the same origin as http://www.example.com/bar but not https://www.example.com/bar because the scheme is different. `,

    answer: `State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component. State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component. i.e, It is not accessible to any component other than the one that owns and sets it. We should always try to make our state as simple as possible and minimize the number of stateful components.`,

    answer: `Props is the shorthand for Properties in React. 
    They are read-only components which must be kept pure i.e. immutable. 
    They are always passed down from the parent to the child components throughout the application. 
    A child component can never send a prop back to the parent component.

     used to render the dynamically generated data.`,

    language: "React",
    question: `9. What is the difference between state and props? `,
    answer: `Both props and state are plain JavaScript objects. While both of them hold information that influences the output of render, they are different in their functionality with respect to component. Props get passed to the component similar to function parameters whereas state is managed within the component similar to variables declared within a function.`,
  },
  {
    id: "r2",
    language: "React",
    question: `10. Why should we not update the state directly?`,
    answer: `If you try to update state directly then it won't re-render the component. nstead use setState() method. It schedules an update to a component's state object. When state changes, the component responds by re-rendering. `,

    question: `11. What is the difference between HTML and React event handling?`,
    answer: `In HTML, the event name should be in lowercase:

    <button onclick='activateLasers()'>
    Whereas in React it follows camelCase convention:
    
    <button onClick={activateLasers}>`,

    question: `12. How to bind methods or event handlers in JSX callbacks? `,
    answer: `1. Binding in Constructor: In JavaScript classes, the methods are not bound by default. The same thing applies for React event handlers defined as class methods. Normally we bind them in constructor. 
    2.Arrow functions in callbacks `,

    id: "r3",
    language: "React",
    question: `13. What are inline conditional expressions? `,
    answer: `You can use either if statements or ternary expressions which are available from JS to conditionally render expressions. Apart from these approaches, you can also embed any expressions in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces and then followed by JS logical operator &&.
    {
      messages.length > 0 && !isLogin?
        <h2>
            You have {messages.length} unread messages.

    language: "React",
    question: `14. What is "key" prop and what is the benefit of using it in arrays of elements?`,
    answer: `A key is a special string attribute you should include when creating arrays of elements. Key prop helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.

    Most often we use ID from our data as key `,

    language: "React",
    question: `15. What is the use of refs?`,
    answer: `The ref is used to return a reference to the element. They should be avoided in most cases, however, they can be useful when you need a direct access to the DOM element or an instance of a component  `,
  },
  {
    id: "r3",
    language: "React",
    question: `16. How to create refs?`,
    answer: `Refs are created using React.createRef() method and attached to React elements via the ref attribute. In order to use refs throughout the component, just assign the ref to the instance property within constructor.

    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props)
        this.myRef = React.createRef()
      }
      render() {
        return <div ref={this.myRef} />

    id: "r3",
    language: "React",
    question: `17.What is Virtual DOM?  `,
    answer: `Document Object Model. A virtual DOM is a lightweight JavaScript object which originally is just the copy of the real DOM. It is a node tree that lists the elements, their attributes and content as Objects and their properties. React’s render function creates a node tree out of the React components. It then updates this tree in response to the mutations in the data model which is caused by various actions done by the user or by the system.
    This Virtual DOM works in three simple steps.
    
    Whenever any underlying data changes, the entire UI is re-rendered in Virtual DOM representation.
    Then the difference between the previous DOM representation and the new one is calculated.
    Once the calculations are done, the real DOM will be updated with only the things that have actually changed.  `,
  },
  {
    id: "r3",
    language: "React",
    question: `18. What do you know about controlled and uncontrolled components?`,
    answer: `Controlled Components - 1. They do not maintain their own state, 2. Data is controlled by the parent component, 3.3. They take in the current values through props and then notify the changes via callbacks. Example: handleChange(event) {
      this.setState({value: event.target.value.toUpperCase()})
    }
    Uncontrolled Components- 1. They maintain their own state, 2. Data is controlled by the DOM, 3.3. Refs are used to get their current values. Example: <input type="text" ref={this.input} />  `,
  },
  {
    id: "r3",
    language: "React",
    question: `19. What is Lifting State Up in React?`,
    answer: `When several components need to share the same changing data then it is recommended to lift the shared state up to their closest common ancestor. That means if two child components share the same data from its parent, then move the state to parent instead of maintaining local state in both of the child components. `,
  },
  {
    id: "r3",
    language: "React",
    question: `20. What are the different phases of component lifecycle? `,
    answer: `The component lifecycle has three distinct lifecycle phases:

    Mounting: The component is ready to mount in the browser DOM. This phase covers initialization from constructor(), getDerivedStateFromProps(), render(), and componentDidMount() lifecycle methods.
    
    Updating: In this phase, the component get updated in two ways, sending the new props and updating the state either from setState() or forceUpdate(). This phase covers getDerivedStateFromProps(), shouldComponentUpdate(), render(), getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() and componentDidUpdate() lifecycle methods.
    
    Unmounting: In this last phase, the component is not needed and get unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase includes componentWillUnmount() lifecycle method.
    
    It's worth mentioning that React internally has a concept of phases when applying changes to the DOM. They are separated as follows
    
    Render The component will render without any side-effects. This applies for Pure components and in this phase, React can pause, abort, or restart the render.
    
    Pre-commit Before the component actually applies the changes to the DOM, there is a moment that allows React to read from the DOM through the getSnapshotBeforeUpdate().
    
    Commit React works with the DOM and executes the final lifecycles respectively componentDidMount() for mounting, componentDidUpdate() for updating, and componentWillUnmount() for unmounting. `,
  },
  {
    id: "r3",
    language: "React",
    question: `21.What are the lifecycle methods of React? `,
    answer: `getDerivedStateFromProps: Invoked right before calling render() and is invoked on every render. This exists for rare use cases where you need derived state. Worth reading if you need derived state.
    componentDidMount: Executed after first rendering and here all AJAX requests, DOM or state updates, and set up event listeners should occur.
    shouldComponentUpdate: Determines if the component will be updated or not. By default it returns true. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after state or props are updated, you can return false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a re-render if component receives new prop.
    getSnapshotBeforeUpdate: Executed right before rendered output is committed to the DOM. Any value returned by this will be passed into componentDidUpdate(). This is useful to capture information from the DOM i.e. scroll position.
    componentDidUpdate: Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes. This will not fire if shouldComponentUpdate() returns false.
    componentWillUnmount It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component. `,

    question: `22. What are Higher-Order Components? `,
    answer: `A higher-order component (HOC) is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. Basically, it's a pattern that is derived from React's compositional nature.

    We call them pure components because they can accept any dynamically provided child component but they won't modify or copy any behavior from their input components.
    
    const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent)
    HOC can be used for many use cases:
    
    Code reuse, logic and bootstrap abstraction.
    Render hijacking.
    State abstraction and manipulation.
    Props manipulation. `,
  },
  {
    id: "r3",
    language: "React",
    question: `23.How to create props proxy for HOC component? `,
    answer: `You can add/edit props passed to the component using props proxy pattern like this:

    function HOC(WrappedComponent) {
      return class Test extends Component {
        render() {
          const newProps = {
            title: 'New Header',
            footer: false,
            showFeatureX: false,
            showFeatureY: true
          }
    
          return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} {...newProps} />
        }
      }
    } `,
  },
  {
    id: "r3",
    language: "React",
    question: `24. What is context?`,
    answer: `Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

    For example, authenticated user, locale preference, UI theme need to be accessed in the application by many components.
    
    const {Provider, Consumer} = React.createContext(defaultValue) `,
  },
  {
    id: "r3",
    language: "React",
    question: `25. What is children prop?`,
    answer: `Children is a prop (this.props.children) that allow you to pass components as data to other components, just like any other prop you use. Component tree put between component's opening and closing tag will be passed to that component as children prop.

    There are a number of methods available in the React API to work with this prop. These include React.Children.map, React.Children.forEach, React.Children.count, React.Children.only, React.Children.toArray.
    
    A simple usage of children prop looks as below,
    
    const MyDiv = React.createClass({
      render: function() {
        return <div>{this.props.children}</div>
      }
    })
    
    ReactDOM.render(
      <MyDiv>
        <span>{'Hello'}</span>
        <span>{'World'}</span>
      </MyDiv>,
      node
    ) `,

  },
  {
    id: "r3",
    language: "React",
    question: `27. What is the purpose of using super constructor with props argument? `,
    answer: `A child class constructor cannot make use of this reference until super() method has been called. The same applies for ES6 sub-classes as well. The main reason of passing props parameter to super() call is to access this.props in your child constructors.

    Passing props:
    
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props)
    
        console.log(this.props) // prints { name: 'John', age: 42 }
      }
    } `,
  },
  {
    id: "r3",
    language: "React",
    question: `28. What is reconciliation? `,
    answer: `When a component's props or state change, React decides whether an actual DOM update is necessary by comparing the newly returned element with the previously rendered one. When they are not equal, React will update the DOM. This process is called reconciliation. `,
  },
  {
    id: "r3",
    language: "React",
    question: `29. What would be the common mistake of function being called every time the component renders? `,
    answer: `You need to make sure that function is not being called while passing the function as a parameter.

    render() {
      // Wrong: handleClick is called instead of passed as a reference!
      return <button onClick={this.handleClick()}>{'Click Me'}</button>
    }
    Instead, pass the function itself without parenthesis: `,
  },
  {
    id: "r3",
    language: "React",
    question: `30.Why React uses className over class attribute? `,
    answer: `class is a keyword in JavaScript, and JSX is an extension of JavaScript. That's the principal reason why React uses className instead of class. Pass a string as the className prop.

    render() {
      return <span className={'menu navigation-menu'}>{'Menu'}</span>
    } `,
  },
  {
    id: "r3",
    language: "React",
    question: `31. What are fragments? `,
    answer: `It's common pattern in React which is used for a component to return multiple elements. Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.  Fragments are a bit faster and use less memory by not creating an extra DOM node. This only has a real benefit on very large and deep trees.
    Some CSS mechanisms like Flexbox and CSS Grid have a special parent-child relationships, and adding divs in the middle makes it hard to keep the desired layout.
    The DOM Inspector is less cluttered.`,
  },
  {
    id: "r3",
    language: "React",
    question: `32. What are stateless components? `,
    answer: `If the behaviour is independent of its state then it can be a stateless component. You can use either a function or a class for creating stateless components. But unless you need to use a lifecycle hook in your components, you should go for function components. There are a lot of benefits if you decide to use function components here; they are easy to write, understand, and test, a little faster, and you can avoid the this keyword altogether. `,
  },

    id: "r3",
    language: "React",
    question: `33. What are stateful components? `,
    answer: `If the behaviour of a component is dependent on the state of the component then it can be termed as stateful component. Hooks let you use state and other React features without writing classes. `,

    question: `35. What are error boundaries? `,
    answer: `Error boundaries are components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.

    A class component becomes an error boundary if it defines a new lifecycle method called componentDidCatch(error, info) or static getDerivedStateFromError()  `,

    question: `36. What is the use of react-dom package? `,
    answer: `The react-dom package provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of your app. Most of the components are not required to use this module. Some of the methods of this package are:

    render()

    } `,
  },
  {
    id: "r3",
    language: "React",
    question: `40. Why we need to pass a function to setState()? `,
    answer: `The reason behind for this is that setState() is an asynchronous operation. React batches state changes for performance reasons, so the state may not change immediately after setState() is called. That means you should not rely on the current state when calling setState() since you can't be sure what that state will be. The solution is to pass a function to setState(), with the previous state as an argument. By doing this you can avoid issues with the user getting the old state value on access due to the asynchronous nature of setState().

    Let's say the initial count value is zero. After three consecutive increment operations, the value is going to be incremented only by one.
    *******************
    // assuming this.state.count === 0
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })
    // this.state.count === 1, not 3
    *******************
    If we pass a function to setState(), the count gets incremented correctly.
    *******************
    this.setState((prevState, props) => ({
      count: prevState.count + props.increment
    }))
    // this.state.count === 3 as expected `,

    question: `41. What is strict mode in React? `,
    answer: `React.StrictMode is a useful component for highlighting potential problems in an application. Just like <Fragment>, <StrictMode> does not render any extra DOM elements. It activates additional checks and warnings for its descendants.  `,
